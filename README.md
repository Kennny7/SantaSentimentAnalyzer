# SantaSentimentAnalyzer

A festive sentiment analysis web application built using Streamlit, designed to analyze the sentiment of Christmas-related messages. The application classifies messages as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the sentiments expressed. This project is perfect for a fun holiday-themed sentiment analysis application.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies messages as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Web UI**: Simple and intuitive Streamlit web interface to interact with the app.
- **CSV Integration**: Loads sample messages from a CSV file and processes them.

## Requirements

This project uses the following Python packages:

- `streamlit`: For building the web interface.
- `textblob`: For sentiment analysis.
- `pandas`: For handling and processing the CSV data.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations (used internally by pandas).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kennny7/SantaSentimentAnalyzer.git
   cd SantaSentimentAnalyzer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

1. Ensure that you're in the project directory.
2. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/app.py
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser. You can now test the sentiment analysis using the sample messages from `data/sample_messages.csv`.

## How It Works

- **Input**: The app takes a message from the user, or it can use the sample messages from the CSV file.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment of the message is analyzed using the TextBlob library. It categorizes the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Output**: The app displays the sentiment classification along with the polarity score of the message.
